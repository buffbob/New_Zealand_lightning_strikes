## New Zealand lightning strikes
<p>A friend said I should look at where lightning strikes often to find gold. So I tried to find lightning strike data for Colorado near the mineral belts. Colorado has good lidar coverage so I thought I would look at the lidar from areas showing a high density of strikes. Alas the data cost a substantial sum and requires a subscription. So I found that New Zealand has the data for free and also some gold deposits. So I thought I would try it all there first. Let me here mention that the notion that lightning is attracted to any metal may not play in the field. As many beleive that regional elevation increases are the main driver of location of lightning strikes. However it was just a project so I carried on.

<p>Most of the gis work was done with qgis and the highlights/summary of such can be found in the Overview1 and Overview2 notebooks. Dag that 25mb limit. The data processing can be on other notebooks.
